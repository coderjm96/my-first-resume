    <h2>MY personal summary</h2>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have proudly managed and operated my own construction business for a successful period of 8 years. This experience allowed me to develop strong leadership and management skills while navigating the challenges of the construction industry.

            In addition to my construction background, I have also dedicated myself to expanding my expertise in software development. I have invested time and effort into studying Python, Java, and full-stack web development. This journey has involved gaining proficiency in essential technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have taken the initiative to explore various frameworks specific to Python and JavaScript, enabling me to build robust and dynamic web applications. Moreover, I have gained hands-on experience working with databases including SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
            
            The fusion of my construction experience with my knowledge of software development has greatly refined my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and adaptability. It has allowed me to approach projects with a unique perspective, leveraging the strengths of both industries.
            
            As I reflect on my career, I recognize that my constant pursuit of knowledge and drive for excellence have been defining factors. Having a diverse skill set in construction and software development enables me to take on complex projects that require a comprehensive understanding of both fields.
            
            Overall, I am proud of my achievements as a business owner and software developer. I am excited to continue leveraging my construction background while making meaningful contributions to the world of software development.</p>
